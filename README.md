# SERVER
### Gig management software for musicians and freelancers

### Forking the Project

Clone this repo as well as [the client](https://github.com/RyanTuckerN/pet-tinder-client).

`cd server && npm i`

- Once dependancies are installed, create a `.env` file at the root of your project and provide the following information:
  - PORT = *choose a port number*
  - JWT_SECRET = *choose a secret*
  - dbName = *name of your local postgres user*
  - dbPass = *associated postgres password*
- create a local **postgres** database with the name 'pet-tinder' 

run `npm start` or `nodemon` in the terminal to start the server.
